# Quikdb
QuikDB was designed to create the database structure quickly and easily, 
with a great similarity to the programming syntax of today's languages.

## Why did we decide to create this language?
We decided to create this language to create a base for an open source community and ecosystem.
Since the existing projects have many limitations when it comes to making new functionalities,
either for not being made with an optimal language or for not being open source.
